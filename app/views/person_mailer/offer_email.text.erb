<%= @sender.name %> wants to pair with you.

You can contact them to arrange a time and a place at <%= @sender.email %>

Remember, before you pair:
  * Agree on a time commitment
  * Agree how the time will be spent. You can spend the whole time working on one project or you can agree to "trade time' across mutual projects. 

While you pair:
  * If possible, have 2 mice and 2 keyboards. Use an editor that both parties can be comfortable and productive with.
  * Try not to spend too much time "driving", that is, operating the mouse and keyboard.
  * If you notice your partner driving too much, simply suggest that maybe you should drive for a bit.
  * If your partner is not engaged with the problem, slow down.  Ask questions out loud, even if you have a solution in mind.
    This may slow progress, but an engaged pair is better able to catch potential bugs, and to offer alternate solutions.
  * If you have a disagreement, keep talking.  Give your pair's ideas the benefit of the doubt.
    Try to come to consensus about how to move forward before starting to write code.
